# JavaScript Tutorial

This repo is designed to learn the basics of `JavaScript`.

# JavaScript Introduction

`JavaScript` is easy to learn because of the very flexible nature of the language, is widely standardized across common browsers and is far more useful than ever before!  

Because `JavaScript` is not a compiled language, things like memory management are not a big concern.

You wonâ€™t find yourself having to worry about loading and unloading content, compiling, or setting primitive data types because most of the heavy lifting is handled by the browser.

 `JavaScript` is a scripting programming language so the code you write does not need to be compiled and as such does not require a compiler or any other expensive software to write. `JavaScript` is just plain text, so all you need to write it is [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)... or any other [text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor).

---

`JavaScript`is a [`prototyping language`]((http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/)). There are two interrelated concepts with *prototype* in `JavaScript`:

+ `prototype property`

+ `prototype attribute`

----

There are lots of tools you can use to debug your `JavaScript` code, making the work easier.

---

While `JavaScript` is probably not the first language that comes to mind when talking about `O.O.P.` (object oriented programming), it is absolutely able to make use of *Object Oriented Design Patterns and principles*.

Using `JavaScript` you can easily create objects and use special `OOP` design patterns. Unlike more structured languages, however, `JavaScript` does not force you to use `OOP`, which can be advantageous for smaller projects.
